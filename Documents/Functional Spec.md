Below that there will be two buttons a “generate” button which, when pressed, will run a random program to randomly generate a pizza. The resulting toppings will be displayed in an alert view and images of the toppings will be overlaid onto the pizza image. There will also be a “toppings” buttons which will go to a table view and allow the user to select and deselect toppings from the toppings pool.
